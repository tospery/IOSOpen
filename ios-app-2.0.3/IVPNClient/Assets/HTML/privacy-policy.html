        <div style="margin: 1em 0.5em">
            <p>As a privacy service we realize how important it is that our customers fully understand what private information we
            collect, store and process. We've tried our best to make this policy clear and simple so you can get the facts you
            need.</p>
            
            <h2>What information do we collect and store when you sign up for our service?</h2>
            
            <p>To ensure your privacy we collect only your email address to facilitate password resets and send important
            security updates relating to our service. You are free to use any email address. We do
            not request or store your name, physical addresses, phone number or any other personal information. Depending on how
            payment for the service is made, some payment information may be related to your account. For example, if Paypal is
            used to pay for the service, a Paypal transaction ID will be associated with your account (as well as the
            subscription ID if a Paypal subscription has been setup).</p>
            
            <p>IVPN is subject to EU law and is in compliance with the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC), which
            prohibits companies transferring data to overseas jurisdictions with weaker privacy laws. IVPN will not locate
            servers in countries where it's forced to break this compliance. Due to the nature of our logging practices VPN
            servers do not contain any personally identifiable information and thus, if seized, could not be used to identify
            users.</p>
            
            <h2>What information is logged when customers connect to our network?</h2>
            
            <p>We do not store any connection logs whatsoever. In addition we do not log bandwidth usage, session data or requests to
            our DNS servers.</p>
            
            <h2>Do you collect or store any usage/stats information relating to an account?</h2>
            
            <p>Unlike many service providers, IVPN purposefully does not log any usage data associated with an account as we provide
            an unlimited and unrestricted quota free service.</p>
            
            <h2>What information is stored when I stop using your service?</h2>
            
            <p>Once a VPN account is terminated on our network due to the subscription ending, non-payment or for any other reason,
            all data associated with that VPN account including the account itself is deleted from all systems. We do not delete
            our customer's client area account which includes the email address and password which they use to sign up for their
            account. However if you wish you can simply request deletion of your client area account by submitting a ticket to
            our billing department.</p>
            
            <h2>What happens if you receive a legal notice such as a DMCA for copyright material that I have downloaded?</h2>
            
            <p>Since our customers are using an IVPN issued IP address when using our service, such notices are directed to IVPN and our legal department
            will issue an appropriate response. Since we store no connection logs, we couldn't associate a request with a
            customer identity even if legally compelled to do so.</p>
            
            <h2>How do we react when requested by an authority for information relating to a customer?</h2>
            
            <p>The company is incorporated in Gibraltar. If a court order is received from a recognized legal authority with
            jurisdiction over IVPN then the company will comply with that order. However, the company cannot be compelled to
            hand over information which it does not have. When a customer signs up we request the minimum information possible,
            a valid email address. If it ever becomes required by law for us to keep a persistent log of our customers
            connections or any personal data relating to their network activity, we will immediately notify our customers and do
            everything in our power to move jurisdictions or close the service to protect those who entrust their privacy to
            us.</p>
            
            <h2>What happens if laws change?</h2>
            
            <p>IVPN is committed to keeping its customers informed of any serious legislative threats to our service. If the laws in
            our jurisdiction change in way that prevents us from upholding our privacy policy we will always inform our
            customers before those laws are enacted. We will also allow customers to cancel their subscription and will refund
            any fees that cover the remainder of their subscription period.</p>
            
            <h2>What information is collected and stored about visitors to our website?</h2>
            
            <p>IVPN have selected Piwik as their web analytics platform. Piwik is open source
            software that is hosted on our own server infrastructure to ensure your privacy (unlike platforms such as Google
            Analytics). For example, the Center for Data Privacy Protection in France (CNIL) recommended
                Piwik as the only tool that can easily ensure full compliance with privacy regulations. Piwik is used to
            analyse in aggregate information about our website visitors. When your web browser loads a page on our site, a small
            snippet of JavaScript code is executed within your browser which submits information such as your browser
            user-agent, language, screen resolution, referring website, IP address etc. To ensure your privacy IVPN discard the
            last two octets of the IP address. Piwik may also set a web
                cookie to facilitate the identification of users who revisit the site.</p>
            
            <h2>Crash Logs</h2>

            <p>By default, if one of our mobile apps crashes while you're using it, anonymized data about the crash will be collected on the device to help us identify the cause of the crash and hopefully fix it in a future update. These "crash logs" contain information such as the state of the app, operating system, and device at the time of the crash, but not your private data.</p>
            <p>On our mobile apps, you can opt-out of crash log reporting by disabling it in user preferences.</p>
            <p>On our desktop apps, crash logs are only sent manually by user action.</p>
            <p>Crash logs are sent to an IVPN controlled server and not third-party vendors.</p>

            <h2>Changes to policy</h2>
            
            <p>IVPN reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time. In such cases, we will take every reasonable step
            to ensure that these changes are brought to your attention by posting all changes prominently on the IVPN web site
            for a reasonable period of time, before the new policy becomes effective as well as emailing our existing
            customers.</p>
